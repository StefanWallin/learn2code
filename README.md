Learn2Code.nu
=============
A list of quality programming learning resources.


## The Goal
The goal is to have a website with a comprehensive list of resources
to engage, inspire and teach fundamentals behind programming

This is to be seen as the go to place for coder dojos, kids hackathons and
similar events to drive programming into new communities.
